### TOP Links for Week00

These are the top 10 links that helped me through this first week.
Though there are only 5, I can attest you that they are helpful.  
If I have the time, I might add some more.

#### 1. Linux Config - Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners

Are you new to bash scripting? Do you not know anything on how to create a good script? Well this website is for you. It gives you the basic overview on how to use bash and some key information regarding it. It also gives examples by showing how it runs on linux.

#### 2. The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Nano, the Linux Command-Line Text Editor

[Beginners Guide to Nano Link](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/)
Is vi too hard for you? Do you want a much easier to use text editor? Then nano is for you. Nano, in my opinion, is a much better and easier to use terminal text editor than vi. This website provides you the key information on how to use nano.

#### 3. Unix/Linux - The vi Editor Tutorial

Do you prefer vi over nano? Well I'm not here to judge, but to help you. This website provides you the key information and basic shortcuts on how to use the terminal text editor vi. Personally I prefer nano than vi, but this website should help you get a hang of it.

#### 4. Dillinger

[Dillinger.io Online Markdown Editor Link](https://dillinger.io/)
Dillinger is an online markdown language renderer. There will be two columns, on the left you write the code, and the website will render it on real-time on the right. I use this website to create this github page that you are viewing right now. Dillinger already wrote a lot and you can use this as reference to see how to create tables, create links, and the sort.

#### 5. OSP4DISS VLSM

[OSP4DISS Link](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)
All of you might and will know this, and probably used this, but this website created by our lecturer really helped me in creating the linux environment on VirtualBox. The information are provided very clearly with example so it is easy to read and understand.
