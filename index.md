### Introduction

Hello World! My name is Stefanus Ndaru Wedhatama, you can call me ```Ndaru```.  
I'm from Jakarta, Indonesia, currently enrolled in Universitas Indonesia, majoring in Computer Science.  
I have interest in UI/UX Design and some other stuff such as Aviation and a little bit of Sci-Fi.

### Top 10 Links

Assuming there will only be one page that contains 10 links for the whole semester, you can access my top 10 links here. There might not be 10 links, but I'll give some links that are very useful, for me atleast.

### This website is created using Markdown.

Markdown is a really lightweight language, highly compatible anywhere, and is useful. No, it does not have any fancy parallax or hover animation, though it has hierarchy so it can still deliver good looking website. Special thanks do dillinger.io for the platform to create, and https://www.markdownguide.org/ for the guides.
