### TIPS for Next Semester

These are the tips that I have as suggestion for the next semester. Take it with a grain of salt. ðŸ™‚ 

#### 1. First Tip - Increase overhead for amount of small mistake that can happen

As we all know, students are humans, and humans make mistake, especially in OS course where mistakes could happen. In my opinion, small mistake should be seperated from heavy mistake and has a high amount of attempt before having reduced score or JOROK POINTS. Small mistake such as forgetting to delete a small file like having random .txt files in TXT or inputting twice in forms because of connection problems should be tolerable, while big mistakes such as messing with git or doesn't do weekly assignment may use the current ATTN system.
